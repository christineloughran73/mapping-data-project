<p>New York has passed its largest-ever environmental bond act in state history with 59 percent of the vote statewide, and 81 percent in New York City. Ahead of the Nov. 8 midterms, a diverse coalition of elected officials, unions and environmental organizations reminded voters to support the $4.2 billion 2022 Clean Water, Clean Air, Green Jobs Bond Act. The act will borrow from state funds to improve air and water quality, preserve parks, increase open space and finance measures classified as climate change mitigation.</p>

<p>Steven Raga, Assemblyman-elect for Assembly District 30 in Queens, was part of a diverse coalition of unions, elected officials and environmental organizations supporting the act.</p>

<p>“Clean air is a big issue,” he said. “Growing up with severe asthma myself and my family, we know it's disproportionately impacting low-income communities and people of color.”</p>

<p>Speaking to the coalition he was part of, he added: “In general we're all big advocates and support anything we can do for New Yorkers to stay healthy.”</p>

<p>The last time an environmental bond act was on the ballot was 1996, election data suggests there was far less widespread support, although it did pass with 55 percent statewide. That year, the percentage of blank or voided votes on the ballot proposal was much higher, according to election results from the Board of Elections – hovering around 50 percent in some state counties. This time around, people participated at a much higher rate. In New York City, the total percentage of combined blank and voided votes on the bond act averaged about 15 percent.</p>
